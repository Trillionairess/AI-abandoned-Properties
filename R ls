# AI for Identifying Abandoned Properties

## Overview
An AI-powered system for detecting, verifying, and cataloguing abandoned properties in urban and rural areas. Integrates web, mobile, backend, and AI modules to streamline reporting and analytics.

## Components

### Frontend (Web App)
A React-based interface that displays maps, property galleries, and analytical dashboards. Users can filter by region, upload photos, and view AI-detected candidates for abandonment.

### Backend (API Server)
A Node.js + Express service that manages user data, property records, and communicates with the AI microservice. Exposes secure endpoints for CRUD operations and geospatial queries.

### Mobile App
A React Native application for field agents to photograph properties, scan QR codes on-site, and submit reports with GPS coordinates. Provides offline caching and sync when online.

### AI Service
A Python Flask microservice that leverages TensorFlow and OpenCV to analyze images for signs of neglect—broken windows, overgrown foliage, structural decay—and scores each property’s abandonment likelihood.

## Setup & Usage

1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `docker-compose up` to launch all services  
3. Visit the web app at `http://localhost:3000`, the mobile app via emulator/device, and the AI API at `http://localhost:5001`
